# Submission

## Deliverables
https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-cm3070-computer-science-final-project/assignment-submission/2n7tw/final-report/step-1/submit/

- PDF Report
- Video
- Public code repository

### Notes
- In addition to the page limits listed, you can have additional pages of images and references.
- You can return to the previous peer reviews for instructions on the first four parts of this submission.
- As well as the report you should submit a 2-5 minute video demonstrating your project working. This should show all the important features of the project and explaining a little of how they work.

Basically the draft report with expanded implementation and two extra sections
- Evaluation
- Conclusion

## Feedback on Preliminary — 64%
> Score 4/5
> Good idea of the project
> Good prototype
> Suggestions
> Score 3/5

- Design items are missing
- More discussion on Excel, Trello, and Sutori :/
- Lacks info on privacy and security
- Plan and idea are good
- Evaluation plan is good

### Tasks
- Formatting
	- [x] Please use more appropriate format and fonts for the cover page (with UOL logo)
	- [x] TOC -> Table of Contents
	- [x] Good format. More appropriate font please
	- [x] Proofreading is needed.
	- [x] Format of references needs revision.
- Literature
	- [x] If Trello cannot guarantee data privacy, how your app can guarantee it? There is no security or privacy in the list of requirements.
	- [x] Good literature review. It is recommended to include Sutori too.
	- [x] When discussion Excel in literature review, its ability to analyse data and news was considered as an advantage. There is no analysis in the requirements for Grid.
- Design
	- [x] Design needs improvement. This should include UML diagrams for analysis, logical design of the database, user interface design, etc.
- Tech
	- [x] Several platforms have been mentioned for development but it is unclear which one has been chosen (e.g., Python or Javascript)?
- Evaluation
	- [x] The feature prototype is not evaluated


## Draft Feedback — 45%

- What are the best things about this project?
  The topic is interesting

- What suggestions do you have for improving this project and report?
  Thanks for submitting the report. Here are some suggestion to improve the work:

- [x] TOC should be replaced with table of Contents
- [x] Use another font, e.g Times new Roman
- [x] The evaluation part should be completed. It is very important to evaluated the work.
- [x] It is better to use more references. Especially some relevant books or published articles if applicable.
- [x] There is no figures/tables in the text! They will help the readers better/faster understand the concepts. The only figure is the Gannt chart which needs a caption.
- [x] There is no result/output, any thing that show that your system works

## Final Tasks

- [ ] Record video
- [x] Open repo
- [x] Polish report
- [ ] Submit

## Review Criteria

### [120 points] Report

You will be marked according to the following criteria (the earlier criteria are the same

1. [10 points] Is the report clearly written and presented?
 - [ ] $ *7/10 The project is presented clearly and in appropriate language*
>    

2. [10 points] Are the diagrams and images appropriate and clear?
  - [ ] $ *7/10 good quality visual that compliment the text and communicate important information*
>    

3. [10 points] Does the report display knowledge of the area of study, previous work and academic literature?
- [ ] $ 8/10 the report gives an overview of the area and well written discussion of at least 4-6 pieces of previous work, based primarily on a good reading of the suggested work from the template
>    

4. [6 points] Does the report critically evaluate the previous work and/or academic literature?
- [ ] $ 4/6 the report situates the project in a critical analysis of previous work
>    

5. [4 points] Does the report use proper citation?
- [ ] $ 4/4 all work mentioned in the report is cited in correct ACM style
>    

6. [12 points] Is the design of the project clear and of high quality?
- [ ] $ 8/12 A clearly described design (including suitable visual communication) corresponding to the “good” level of project described in the template
>    

7. [8 points] Is the project concept justified based on the domain and users?
- [ ] ? 4/8 the project concept includes some reference to the domain and users but without a full analysis of requirements
- [ ] $ 6/8 the project concept is based on a clear and evidenced argument for the requirements of users and/or the domain
>    

8. [22 points] Is the final implementation of high quality?
- [ ] ? 15/22 there is a prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “good” or “excellent” level of project described in the template, but it has many bugs and flaws
- [ ] $ 18/22 there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “good” level of project described in the template
>    

9. [8 points] Is the final implementation technically challenging?
- [ ] ? 3/8 This prototype includes some of the more difficult techniques or algorithms taught in this degree
- [ ] $ 6/8 This prototype includes some very difficult techniques or algorithms that go beyond what is taught in this degree (closer to masters or professional level)
>    

10. [6 points] Is the evaluation strategy appropriate to the aims of the project?
- [ ] $ 5/6 it is a well thought out strategy that builds on that proposed in the template
>    

11. [5 points] Does the evaluation display good coverage of appropriate issues?
- [ ] $ 4/5 the evaluation covers the major important areas of the project
>    

12. [5 points] Are the results of the evaluation presented well?
- [ ] ? 3/5 the write up of the evaluation is hard to read, omits important information or contains errors
- [ ] $ 4/5 the results are clearly presented in a way that is easy to follow for computer scientist
>    

13. [4 points] Are the evaluation results used to critically analyse the project with respect to the objectives of the project?
- [ ] ? 2/4 the project presents some analysis but it is simplistic (e.g. just using results to say how good the project it) and/or does not address the objectives of the project
- [ ] $ 3/4 a balanced, evidenced analysis of the good and bad aspects of the project relative to the original objectives
>    

14. [10 points] Does the project display evidence of originality?
- [ ] ? 5/10 this type of project is novel or original in comparison with the large majority of undergraduate projects
- [ ] $ 8/10 an original piece of work that goes considerably beyond undergraduate level and is closer to what would be expected at masters level or at the level of a valuable new product development
>    

### [10 points] Video
- [7 points] Is the final product of high quality?
	- [ ] ? 5/7 there is a prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “good” or “excellent” level of project described in the template, but it has many bugs and flaws
	- [ ] $ 6/7 there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “good” level of project described in the template
- [3 points] Is the implementation that is described technically challenging?
