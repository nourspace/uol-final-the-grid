# Critiquing Previous work

We need to critique 4 projects

- Does the video display knowledge of the area of study and previous work?
- Are they showing some knowledge of this area?
- Does the video critically evaluate the previous work?
- Are they evaluating that work in any way that can inform the design of that projects? 

## Think outside the box
Might compare the finance app to
- Excel sheet
- Paper and pen
- QuickBooks

## Tips
- Make sure to illustrate what the other work does and how it does it
	- For software
		- mention the technical aspect and the tech being used
		- integrations
- Inform how I'd be different to other work and how I'd develop my own project
- Bring insights from the previous work
	- number of users
	- target audience
- Mention benefits and problems/gaps
