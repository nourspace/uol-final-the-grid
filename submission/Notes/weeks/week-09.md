# Prototyping and evaluation

## Feature Prototype

Implement the most important feature.

## Ideas
- **AirTable skimmed demo**
	- Not really sure what to present and how to evaluate.
- Backend: **FastAPI server with GraphQL db** or Nuxt and Prism?...
	- Could be a nice intro to actually start development.
	- Validates assumptions on backend tech: REST vs. GraphQL, DB ORM
	- Can evaluate easily since my goal is building a blueprint for developing apps.
- Frontend: Nuxt UI for the entries page
	- Nice intro to start
	- Validates assumptions on frontend tech: framework, libraries
	- Validates assumptions on UX

- [ ] Pick one

The example in video
- Simple UI and how UX works
- Simple one page code, pick a highlighted piece
Basically he used some actual pages and code.
