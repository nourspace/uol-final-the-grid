## The Grid, GraphQL, and AI
I was experimenting with ChatGPT. I provided it with my GraphQL schemaâ€“only the tables, no relations or aggregations as it claimed it understands how Hasura engine works.
Next, I started asking it questions so it returns queries. I'd then plug in these in GraphQL console and not to my surprise, I received actual results!
