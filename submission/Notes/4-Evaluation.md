Hi friends, I'm sending you this video to demo my bachelor thesis and kindly ask you for your feedback.
https://youtu.be/pg6vUc8xK2I

There are 3 parts ~1min each
- Idea
- Demo of the current version
- Proof of concept for the next version

You can access the app at https://grid.nour.space;

Register, log in, log out, create, add, and delete. There is nothing right of wrong you can do, so don't worry.

What I'm asking you to do is to basically
1. Watch the video
2. Test the app
3. Send ANY feedback; questions, comments, screenshots, or video of you dancing with The Grid in the background is also a good form of feedback.

Thank you
```

### Responses
I sent the letter to dozen friends and received around 8 concrete responses.

#### 1. Tahir
- Was confused about concepts and terminology
	- Asked questions
	- After my explanation, he seemed to understood
	- Did not identify the link between entities, as that also does not show on UI
- Managed to create account and create all kinds of entities
#### 2. Abood
- Liked the idea
- Created account and an activity
- Was not able to delete and edit others entities, it was not clear he can't
- Highlighted the web app speedy responses
#### 3. Safa
testing
- The 'Items per page' does not work. Selecting other numbers does not reflect any changes on the assets, activities, and task pages
- The search bar only starts showing results after inputting the 3rd character. I thought the search function is bugged before i realised I need to type 3 characters or more (including space)
- The sorting arrows on the grid columns (asc and desc) do not work.
- I dont understand what the Test page is for but its cool. The click stops working at '3' for some reason
- Typo in About page 'Gird'

comments/questions
- The app is very easy to use and quite straightforward. I can tell by looking at posts from different users that this could become a great collaboration tool for people with interest in research and journalism as mentioned in your project aims
- In theory, is there supposed to be just one version of The Grid and everyone works on the same 'platform'? I mean, is it like Wikipedia where everyone adds the content to one version of the website or is it like Trello where each user/team has a platform that is unique to them?
- 
#### 4. Alan
Good: 
very fast website
Mobile friendly interface 
Bad: 
Logo is very basic
Not clear how to utilize this site, add about/FAQ page
#### 5. Ibrahim
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4cuawk1J0GGdqvln2MRNiugQhJa-fXwMwzjGGETX00/edit
- First trial: UI bugs
	- The first thing I noticed ist that the PSW Field  is visible. I think it have to be hidden
	- When a week PSW is used, you receive not a clear ErrorMsg, I think it has to be more clearly  E.g. (Week PSW, you must use Character, Numbers etc)
- Second trial: more in depth testing
  As I tested the App, I understand that it’s made to be like an organizing dashboard ?
  I have a very important question before I start. 
  Is this a public app where everyone adds their (activities, Assets and so on) on the main Page, or do you want to make more Dashboards, where one or more persons can share their Ideas-Tasks?
  I would like to have the option to have my own dashboard, which I can share with others.
  And it will be better if I have the Option of making more dashboards
	- Starting with Assets:
	  It’s good to define an asset and set a category ( I would like to have more Categories, and have the option to make my own categories?)
	- Bug: I can’t comment.
	  So I add my comment, and can add empty comments also, but after I close the Category, my comments will disappear (it’s not working by activities and tasks as well)
	- By Activities I wonder if it’s possible to integrate a protocol to each topic. So when and by which user which changes are made.
	- At Tasks I wonder which activities are those to see when you open a task and why you need them here ?
	- I would also like to have a reminder by the tasks, so it gives you a notification or the task change its color when the time is due. 

#### 6. Bantonia
Hello Nour, first of all, congratulations on your project. It looks wonderful, and I am very much looking forward to using it. Honestly, if I could get an empty version to start adding some articles and notes about my lab research, I would use it now. No worries if a separate file is not yet possible.

I find it interesting that when adding an entry category, the ellipsis doesn't disappear until pressing save. Cool.

I didn't understand what the short notes and colors above the comment section were for. When I clicked on it, the whole window closed, and the text and link didn't save.

After having the tab open for 12 hours, trying to click on assets doesn't work. I am able to click on "about," then refresh and asked to login again.

When logging in, I have to click on the username and password fields first for LastPass to fill in. On other pages, LastPass fills in automatically.

Regarding activities, when I click on the source, a new tab opens, but the old tab now has the entry open, and I have to close it. The entry shouldn't open when I only click on the source.

#### 7. Usef K
- Registered, logged in, logged out all working well
- When I click on an item
  Screen gets locked I can’t scroll down the “edit asset” window. Only the “comments” window
- Same thing when I need to create new task Using iPhone
  
#### 8. Usef A
- You mentioned that Trello and Notion are not really privacy preserving, The Grid seems to have 0 privacy as everyone are working together.
- Unless I did not understand the idea well.
- In general and from my little experience with the site is that it is a site for publishing, sharing ideas and tasks with your team. Is that correct?
- Something like a WhatsApp group but in a more organised, or different, way


### Conversations
I also had two longer conversations worth mentioning where I discussed the concept of The Grid and how to use the web app.

#### Alan
- Summary:
```
In this conversation, Nour is discussing their project called "Grid," which was initially unclear to Alan. Nour explains that it is designed for internal use by teams and not as a public online service. The purpose of Grid is to help store and organize information, making it easier to produce content and be easily parsed by AIs. It is meant for average-sized teams of about 10-20 workers.

Alan seeks clarification on how Grid could work for a specific use case, and Nour provides a detailed example involving creating a guide on setting up 0L miners. The conversation helps Alan understand that Grid is a crowdsourced, incentivized research platform designed for internal use. Nour emphasizes that it is intended for those interested in accumulating knowledge and hiring people to collect data for them. Alan finally grasps the concept and thanks Nour for the explanation.

 ```js
 [01:16, 18/03/2023] Nour W: is this understandable now? I added text to the about page
 it seems many think this is like an online service, which isn't
 
 https://grid.nour.space/about
 [01:17, 18/03/2023] Alan: Yes the idea is clearer
 [01:18, 18/03/2023] Nour W: one sec pls
 [01:18, 18/03/2023] Alan: If it's supposed to be something people use them a "how to use" section would be helpful
 
 [01:19, 18/03/2023] Nour W: yeah sure. think of it though like an internal amazon tool.
 [01:19, 18/03/2023] Nour W: so teams would be onboarded to use it
 [01:20, 18/03/2023] Nour W: they won't have to figure it out
 [01:20, 18/03/2023] Alan: Makes sense
 [01:32, 18/03/2023] Nour W: what Qs you said you have? can I use these in the report :D ?
 [01:36, 18/03/2023] Alan: 😂
 [01:37, 18/03/2023] Alan: I don't think I get the whole idea
 [01:37, 18/03/2023] Alan: Not specific questions
 [01:39, 18/03/2023] Nour W: database, that's it
 [01:41, 18/03/2023] Nour W: if you get into publishing and researching it would make more sense
 [01:42, 18/03/2023] Nour W: instead of bookmarks, notes, etc in multiple app, you store information in a way that makes it easier to produce something.
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: Yes that part I get
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Nour W: and the way everything is stored is easily parsable by AIs
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: When few people use
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: But how can hundreds use it? Cuz I recall you Wana do it bigger
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: Also this isn't important for now
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: What can I help
 
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Nour W: it won't get too big
 [01:43, 18/03/2023] Alan: To finish report
 [01:44, 18/03/2023] Nour W: it is made for average size teams
 [01:44, 18/03/2023] Nour W: so if I have 10-20 workers it would be amazing
 [01:45, 18/03/2023] Nour W: this conversation is great help already, It is important to see how people perceive it
 [01:45, 18/03/2023] Nour W: I will turn this and other chats into QA I did and what actions I took
 [01:47, 18/03/2023] Alan: Okay so can you give me example. Can i use grid for the following use case, if yes, what that would look like..  assuming a team of 20 already using it 
 
 I have pre nodes and want to learn how to mine 0L on them
 
 [01:52, 18/03/2023] Nour W: yes, possible and a good use case.
 1. Place a task; "Create a guide on setting up 0L miners". Add some description and links you want read and summerized (maybe later set an incentive/bounty)
 2. Workers pick your task and
 3. Start doing different activities; reading, watching, etc while logging their findings
 4. Top workers utilise the activity summaries to produce the final doc you asked for
 [01:55, 18/03/2023] Nour W: It could be also that the grid already has many entires about 0L
 
 So you could first bring everything (activities, tasks, articles) related to 0L (asset) and might find what you are looking for as someone has already done it or written about it
 [01:56, 18/03/2023] Nour W: By you reading, you might be the one that writes that article. Someone else will use it, or is willing to pay a bounty for just having it there.
 [01:57, 18/03/2023] Alan: Okay starting to get the concept
 [01:57, 18/03/2023] Alan: Crowdsourced incentived  research platform
 [01:57, 18/03/2023] Alan: ?
 [01:57, 18/03/2023] Nour W: eywa eywa
 [01:58, 18/03/2023] Nour W: but really for internal use and not a public internet thing, at least it is not meant to be one
 [01:59, 18/03/2023] Nour W: the idea that those interested in accumulating knowledge will run their instance and hire people to collect data for them. 
 [02:04, 18/03/2023] Alan: I seee, I think i got it - thanks for explaining!

 ```

#### Tahir
- Summary
```
In this conversation, Tahir seeks clarification on the definitions of assets, activities, and tasks, and how they are linked to each other. Nour explains that assets are topics or items that activities and articles would be about, activities are related to one or more assets, and tasks are used to track work on articles.

Tahir wants to understand how to use the website to upload articles and divide them into assets, activities, and tasks. Nour provides an example using a research topic about Islam during 690 AD. They explain that they would first create assets, then add activities as they research and find articles, videos, etc. Finally, they would create a task to research the topic.

Nour mentions that the UI is missing some features to link activities to assets and tasks, but they are working on it. A project would consist of one or more tasks, and collaborators would read and summarize input to produce an article or research paper. Tahir tries using the website, and Nour provides feedback on their attempt. Nour also thanks Tahir for the helpful feedback on the platform.

 ```js
 [23:36, 15/03/2023] Tahir: What is the definition of asset ? activities and task?
 [23:36, 15/03/2023] Tahir: and how are they linked to each other I didnt understand
 
 [23:40, 15/03/2023] Nour W: great questions
 [23:40, 15/03/2023] Nour W: - Assets
   Topics or particular assets that activities and articles would be about.
 - Activities
   Something that the users did and is related to one or more assets.
 - Tasks
   To track work on articles.
 [23:41, 15/03/2023] Nour W: there are missing fields in the UI that allow you to select
 - assets when creating an activity
 - activities when creating a task
 
 Tahir: ok I will upload an article to your website
 Tahir: how to divide an article into assets, activitiy, and task?
 Tahir: I think a task is the reviews?
 Tahir: until now I did not understand how to use the website to upload articles
 Tahir: this is a upload to upload scientific articles, correct?
 Nour:the goal is to produce articles
 Tahir: ok got it
 Nour: so let's say we have a topic we want to research
 
 [00:05, 16/03/2023] Tahir: 
 [00:05, 16/03/2023] Nour W: we want to research a topic; say islam during 690AD
 [00:06, 16/03/2023] Nour W: so we first add a few assets; islam, history, arabia
 [00:08, 16/03/2023] Nour W: then we start researching and find a few articles, videos, etc online
 article 1, video 1, article 2, ....
 We add these as activities 
 the type, our notes on what we have 'done/read/watched', like a summary, and ofc the source url or name
 [00:09, 16/03/2023] Nour W: Finally or at the same time, we create a task called; Research Islam in Arabia during 7th Century.
 [00:10, 16/03/2023] Nour W: later once I fix the UI, we will be able to link activities to assets and tasks, so we know why someone read x or watched y.
 
 [00:10, 16/03/2023] Nour W: so we know why someone read x or watched y.
 [00:11, 16/03/2023] Tahir: Perfect there is a missing link now … which is to link all three in one big project
 [00:11, 16/03/2023] Tahir: Ok now it’s understood
 [00:12, 16/03/2023] Nour W: there will be another list: Articles (the ones we produce)
 [00:12, 16/03/2023] Tahir: The outcome
 [00:13, 16/03/2023] Nour W: a project consists of one or more tasks. we ask collaborators to read and summerize and then use their input to produce an article
 [00:13, 16/03/2023] Nour W: or research paper
 [00:14, 16/03/2023] Nour W: a project* I meant article/research
 [00:14, 16/03/2023] Nour W: these things are missing on the UI
 
 - Articles
   Final product; a report, summary, or blog article.
 - Comments
   Text communication on other entities.
 - Attachments
   Files and images related to other entities
 [00:17, 16/03/2023] Nour W: but really thanks for checking this 🙏
 [00:17, 16/03/2023] Nour W: very helpful feedback
 [00:23, 16/03/2023] Tahir: Done
 [00:31, 16/03/2023] Tahir: Does it make sense? What I did
 [00:32, 16/03/2023] Nour W: niiice!
 [00:33, 16/03/2023] Nour W: I think you kind of needed a single asset; ww2
 [00:33, 16/03/2023] Nour W: task is correct
 [00:34, 16/03/2023] Nour W: everything else seems like an activity for me
 [00:36, 16/03/2023] Nour W: but ofc, you would also narrow down the ww2 topic and have 4 different assets as you did. so you would relate activities to the most relevant asset.
 For future, we could create assets hierarchy; assets and sub assets. precisely for such case.
 [00:39, 16/03/2023] Tahir: Great
 ```

### Improvements
During and following the feedback responses and interviews I managed to do the following
#### UI
- [x] Display assets as chips on activities table
- [x] M2M selectors: assets on activity
- [x] Mock M2M relations on the UI
	- [x] Activities on tasks
	- [x] Comments on assets, activities, and tasks
- [x] Password field showing clear text
- [x] Improve errors display on login and register forms
- [x] Remove unused test page
- [x] Improve searches to look in more fields
      Assets: creator username
      Activities: creator username, assets name
      Tasks: creator username
- [x] Better CRUD dialog
	- [x] Remove Edit/Delete icons from the table
	- [x] Click on table row to open dialog
	- [x] Add "Delete" action to dialog
	- [x] Only enable form edit/delete/save for-entity owner
- [x] Improved forms and added simple validation
#### Concepts
- [x] Improved home and about pages
      More context on what the platform does, why, and how
- [x] Renamed "Asset" to "Topic" on ui
      This seems to have created confusion on what an asset it
- [x] Added tooltips on all datatables to explain what an entity is

### Responses
I sent the letter to dozen friends and received around 7 concrete responses.
#### Ibrahim
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4cuawk1J0GGdqvln2MRNiugQhJa-fXwMwzjGGETX00/edit
- I found the option to make a new article while making a new task is very useful.
  The question is, can I also do it the other way? Like can I connect a task /make a new task to my article ? 
- I also noticed that I can post an Activity with empty content
  Shouldn’t I at least had to give a type or something ?

#### Vim
Placing feedback here:

- login/logout functionality works great
- main navigation list works great
- I like the info bubbles next to button (new topic, new activity etc)
- the WIP informs me what is coming
- when clicking on any topic, it says “Edit Topic:47”, however the drop downs are not responding. This makes me wonder if I’m able to edit these? If I’m not able to edit them maybe chanage the mouse cursor to indicate that the drop-down is disabled?
- filling out the new activity, topic task and article works great
- seerch works really well! 

Overall seems super functional and when WIPs are completed it will make things better
When creating a New Activity:

- the topics select box has multiple options for the same value. For example “World War 2” appears 4 times.

[01:33, 25/03/2023] Nour W: anything thoughts on the idea itself and the concepts?
[01:50, 25/03/2023] +1 (831) 238-8417: The concept itself is super important. In this day and age of mis-information and journalists being silenced in authoritarian regimes, this tool could be a major win for democracy. So it’s super important.

I found it easy to use which is good. 

Also a UX perspective, I wonder if a video or flowchart can be added to provide the “end to end” mental model to the user (journalist/ researcher)? The video explains how to use the tool generally and maybe having specific examples like “How to do your research to create an article on AI”? 

Also is there an idea to create a “publish” button so that the user can see the article ?
[01:50, 25/03/2023] +1 (831) 238-8417: Awesome work!

[18:21, 25/03/2023] Nour W: I'm glad you got the concepts and liked the project in general.
[18:22, 25/03/2023] Nour W: Since this would be rather an internal tool for teams, I expect that those brining it to their team will do the teaching work. It is not intended to be a public offering or generic tool. So it is up to the team how they utilise it.

#### Usef K
[09:22, 22/03/2023] Usef Al-Khanchi: no comments from my side, the app seems very smooth and quick
[09:22, 22/03/2023] Usef Al-Khanchi: i followed your workflow

#### Hemulin
- I'm not sure how to provide this feedback, I'll just write my thoughts stream and passing remarks.

- Clean and functional design

- Too rudimentary for a mass product but very passing as MVP (not sure about your intentions with this project, uni submission and done, or further development and usage) 
> Nour: Current version is the uni submission. I'm happy with it and it requires no further dev. I'm only collecting feedback to relfect on its current state. In general The Grid is a local tool so no mass product is planned. There will be many Grids however. Each having its own users and content. You can think of it as a smarter excel sheet for reporters/researchers, not a public service like Trello.

- Vue favicon

- Stumbled onto [WIP] text

- The hierarchy is not clear. The relations between the different entities.

- I created a task and marked the checkbox to create article (type research paper) on the task. The article doesn't seem to be created

- I don't understand what is a task and what is an activity.
  Why editing a task loads mock activities view?
> Nour: Activities are what team members do regardless. Activities revolve around Topics. Tasks on the other hand are explicit instructions to do something, which would involve doing some activities. These activities done onbehalf of a certain task are shown below the task. There is nothing on the UI that link these yet. Therefore you see a mocked activtites list.

- When coming to think about a project management tool, I don't think "Topics" would be the first item on the menu. Assuming it is expected to be a larger container, it is more of a meta thing. I would flip it. From small to big. Tasks, activities, topics. Articles are the end goal, but from the application standpoint, just a final by-product.
> Nour: Great point on highlighting the order of dashboards. If you however think that the topics are very important and you want to understand what's going on (activities, tasks) related to a certain topic they become as important.

- I see the explanation in the "About". Still not convinced.
  I think task and activity can merge and you can have perhaps a type (drop-down) on the merged entity.
> Nour:  As I mentioned, not every activity is related to a task. Even when I interviewed a real world reporter, he liked that we can document what we read/watch to later on come up with an article idea based on what's available. So tasks can happen because of activities and vice versa

- In the "About" you write
    - Offer a private solution ensuring user privacy and content ownership
    - Optimize the authoring process for efficiency and simplicity
    - Structured information storage
    - Effortless information retrieval
   Where and how do you present that?

> Nour: The Grid is a locally deployed tool so it preserves privacy and ownership. On the technical side, it is a GraphQL engine which allows complex queries. Current UI is only a PoC of what can be done. The most likely end UI is a single page with a button to command an AI, and a canvas that displays results.

- As a project management tool. I find the current structure non-trivial.
  Maybe it is just a matter of layout (maybe if the entities would demonstrate some hierarchy it would be clearer), or maybe because I got used to Jira, Trello and the like. In its current way, I don't see myself using it.
> Nour: Good feedback thanks. I will have to think of this.

- Maybe I'm missing the point with it. Do you see people in specific fields using it because it brings value which is unique to them (researchers, journalists)?
> Nour: As mentioned in the video (I hope you saw it), it is made for reporters and researcher.

- If the point is about the technology, I think it is also missed. I don't have any increased understanding about the technological features from using the platform.
> Nour: The project has multiple components; Postgres, GraphQL engine, auth backend, static ui. It can run using single docker-compose up and you have your private info storage and task manager. What I envision teams working on gathering most likely sensitive information need.

That's about it for this testing session !

- jwt has invalid signature according to jwt.io
> Nour: JWT claims won't be valid unless you have the secret they were signed with ^^
- I see the AllTasks and AllEnums fetching. Where are they stored? Are you fetching all db data on load event and storing in-memory?
> Nour: I use Apollo client which takes care of caching everything you see on the ui. There are things like Enums that I download on startup, but otherwise I request info as you open pages. Response times are below 20ms which I'm nicely surprised with.

#### Cat
The app looks really good! Only issue I had was that I couldn't scroll down to see the bottom of this block

#### Usef A
[20:36, 25/03/2023] Yousef : can you add some regex to the title of the topic?
[20:36, 25/03/2023] Yousef : like... I can add "|"
[20:37, 25/03/2023] Yousef : and if you try to save(create) a new topic with the title of just a space
[20:37, 25/03/2023] Yousef : it won't work and nothing would happen
[20:39, 25/03/2023] Yousef : nor an error (warning) or saving it just like it is
[20:39, 25/03/2023] Yousef : you can add an empty activity
[20:39, 25/03/2023] Yousef : just like what "Ibrahim" did
[20:39, 25/03/2023] Yousef : and I tried it too
[20:40, 25/03/2023] Yousef : in the task section...
[20:41, 25/03/2023] Yousef : you can add an empty task and even relate it to an article
[20:42, 25/03/2023] Yousef : and as demonstrated in the video you shared with me when creating a task and add it to an article the "title" has the "task: name of the task"
[20:43, 25/03/2023] Yousef : if the title of the task is empty the title of the article will be "Task:"
[20:47, 25/03/2023] Yousef : but you improved it be making each user have certain permissions like I can't delete or edit others' work
[20:48, 25/03/2023] Yousef : the ui is made for desktops but some have (like me [talking about myself I guess]) have a screen of 1920x1080
[20:48, 25/03/2023] Yousef : which makes the ui a little bit crunched...
[20:48, 25/03/2023] Yousef : if i zoomed out it looks much better
[20:49, 25/03/2023] Yousef : I know what matters is the functionality not the appearance of it
[20:50, 25/03/2023] Yousef : but you know....
to attract the audience you should have a good UI, not the best but something good
[20:50, 25/03/2023] Yousef : I guess I tested it to some extent
[20:51, 25/03/2023] Yousef : and yes XD
you pointed out that the comments are mock data and the comment section doesn't work XD

#### Huzaifa
- Yoo been testing out grid! 
  video is great (content wise is good, has a good explanation and comparison) , I am assuming you'll make a video for the submission itself for the just voice and presentation part , content is good

- from the app POV, one thing I would say is , on the about page, can you add a sample workflow of 1 complete event, start to end, how you envision it.
- Basically giving a full walkthrough of the process, how you envision it, on a best case scenario, as a link on the About page. 
- In the video portion of things, when you do it, it's a littler hard to still get how the 4 relate to each other:
  Topics, Activities, Tasks, Articles.
  Something like this :
  1) Topic
     Find a topic, like food inflation in Germany, you might find this related to multiple topic, like Food, Prices and Germany Cost of Living, these are the topics that you would want to read/learn more about and want to gear the research towards
     Enter the URL
     Enter the titles (over time you'll build a repository of titles) 
  2) Activities
     Think of all the things you need to  around this topic and break them into smaller tasks 
     Enter the source of this information in the source box
     Enter your understanding of the article in the notes box
 3) Tasks 
    Add a task for your activity 
    Here thare are 4 status:
    Essentially a full walkthrough of each option and what a good complete cycle of information addiotion and analysis would look like
- but just the explanation in the video doesn't do justice to the layout and the options available in the app


### Interviews
I interviewed a researcher and a reporter after they have already used The Grid for sometime.
### A.K.
A. is a journalism masters student who is also working for DW and other local news agency in Berlin.

> Phone call

#### Highlights from A.
- Interesting idea and project. It seems like a nice tool for sharing ideas.
- When first opened the app, I didn't get anything
- Assets, tasks, activities seem not connected
- When things are connected it sounds easy and makes total sense

#### Questions
- A: is it for individuals or teams?
  If for teams;
	  They add ideas under assets
	  Activities: write about what we want to do
	  Tasks; research shooting editing
- A: Activities could be converted to tasks?
- A: What are the differences? This or WordPress
- A: how does it work for those working from home?

#### Facts
- A: In DW; we have internal system, Horizon
	- We can open Horizon from home using VPN
	- Can not access archive from home
	- 60k employees utilise this system
- A: For (News agency in Berlin)
	- They use Trello
	- Todo tasks are accessed and edited by others
	- Trello is not giving flexibility to collect and link items

#### Thoughts about note taking and todo list apps
- A: When people see some activities, it might be interesting to create output
- A: Issues with Notion
	- Takes so much time to create workflow
	- Could utilise the time to do actual work
- A: Trello
	- Used as personal task manager
	- Simple; throw tasks and get back to them later
- A: Tried Todoist, but moved to MS Tasks
	- No need to organise
	- Also used for home errands
- A: Mostly, using Outlook Calendar and Tasks
	- I could not manage using only a paper notebook calendar
	- I like kinking all calendars digitally

#### Feedback on The Grid UI
- What is ID for assets? not needed
- Would be nice to have sub category
  Instead of crypto etc, we could have main category: Finance
- Not obvious we can interact with comments
- Assets require renaming; topic (better than category)

### B.W.
B. is Mind and Brain masters student and works at a research lab at Charité Berlin

>Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4i0SlsaBUB5lnEwDoa4kq9IRbEHRGd-7n09hSAOWq8/edit

#### Qs
- As science student and researcher, which tools do you use the most in your studies at the lab?
  Mostly interested in how you document ideas, activities, decisions and other important information?  
> In our small team, we used to communicate and share ideas on WhatsApp and on Google drive. Lately, we started to store ideas and activities on Notion and Microsoft Teams.

- How sensitive is the data you are working with in general?
> We store participants' birth month and year and behavioural and physiological data anonymously.

- Are you comfortable having your experiment records saved on the cloud like Google Drive, Trello, or by third party services like Trello or Notion?
> Not really. Unfortunately, we had to opt for saving some behavioural data in Google drive. We are looking for a better solution to store our data.

- How often do you publish articles?
> Once in a year or two. We prepare abstracts for conferences and presentations several times a year.

- You have used the grid for over two months since it was a PoC, could you rate the following from 1 to 5, 1 being too bad, and 5 too good.
	- Idea; local storage of structured information
	- Concepts; topics, activities, tasks, articles
	- UI
		- Functionality
		- Design
		- Navigation
		- Responsiveness
> Idea; local storage of structured information 5
> Concepts; topics, activities, tasks, articles 4
> UI
> Functionality 4
> Design 4
> Navigation 3
> Responsiveness 3

- What did you like/hate the most about the app?
> I found it annoying you can only add one link as a source. In general, the source functionality would need to improve to help scientists save citations and papers.
> I really enjoy the simplicity and categorisation of entries.

- Are you going to use the grid at university?
> Yes, I plan to start using it this week to store literature for a paper.

- How about at work? Do you think your team lead and colleagues will give it a try if we help them setup their own Grid instance?
  > My colleagues and the team lead could also make use of the Grid.  I would first like to use it for a scientific project for a week or two to show them related functionality myself.

- Do you have any special request for future versions of the grid?
> Maybe you could get some inspiration from Zotero for the sources section.

- Do you have any questions or final thoughts you want me to add to my evaluation?
  > Looking forward to starting to use the app for my science projects and university work. Best of luck

Thanks!

## Round 2 Summary

The second round of testing The Grid saw significant improvements in user feedback compared to the first round. The addition of context and the About page helped to reduce confusion among testers, although some misconceptions still persisted. The Grid received detailed feedback on almost every aspect of the website, which allowed me to make crucial improvements and gain a better understanding of user needs. The following sections provide a more in-depth look at the main areas of focus during this testing phase.

### Concepts

One of the main points of confusion for users during the second round of testing was the difference between Activities and Tasks. The generic nature of these terms led to misconceptions, making it difficult for users to grasp the intended distinctions. This feedback highlighted the need for clearer explanations and more specific terminology to help users differentiate between these two concepts.

### Functionality and Technical Issues

During the second round of testing, users faced several functionality and technical issues. Some users had difficulty navigating the user interface, while others reported problems with responsiveness. Additionally, certain features, such as the ability to add only one link as a source, were found to be limiting, prompting suggestions for improvement.

### Interviews

Two interviews were conducted during the second round of testing:

#### A.K.

A.K., a journalism masters student working for DW and other local news agencies in Berlin, found The Grid to be an interesting idea and a potentially useful tool for sharing ideas. However, they also experienced confusion regarding the connections between Assets, Tasks, and Activities. A.K. expressed interest in trying The Grid with their team to see if it could enhance their collaborative workflow.

#### B.W.

B.W., a Mind and Brain masters student working at a research lab at Charité Berlin, appreciated the simplicity and categorization of entries in The Grid. They encountered some issues with the source functionality and expressed interest in using the app for their scientific projects and university work. B.W. also indicated a willingness to introduce The Grid to their colleagues and team lead after trying it out themselves for a week or two.

### Improvements Made

Based on user feedback, several improvements were made during the second round of testing:

-   Concepts and terminology were refined to reduce confusion.
-   The Grid was clarified as a local platform, not an online service.
-   The "Articles" feature was added to provide a more comprehensive user experience.

### Key Takeaways

The second round of testing provided valuable insights into user needs and highlighted areas for improvement. Key takeaways from this round included:

-   The need to clarify the distinction between Activities and Tasks.
-   The importance of addressing functionality and technical issues to enhance the user experience.
-   The willingness of users to try The Grid with their teams, demonstrating its potential for collaborative work.

In conclusion, the second round of testing proved to be an essential step in refining The Grid and gaining a better understanding of user needs. With the valuable feedback received and improvements made, The Grid is well on its way to becoming a more effective and user-friendly tool for organizing and sharing ideas.

## Personal Evaluation

### Overall

- Successes
	- Managed to implement the grid core features how I envisioned them in the given time
	- Convinced two professional teams to test The Grid in their work
  
- Failures
	- Was not able to completely eliminate the confusion on concepts
	- Almost missed the deadline without the extension, but that applies to everyone I guess

- Limitations
	- Time: could have done more on the UI
	- Test users base: could have used more professional feedback

- Possible extensions
	- Definitely AI integration: I already carried some tests and was able to generate meaningful GraphQL queries based on given natural language requests.

### Technical
- Technologies Used
	- Very happy with chosen languages and frameworks.
	- Was steep learning curve to onboard myself with Vue, GraphQL, Hasura, and others.

- Performance and Optimization
	- Outstanding when hosted on regular server. Both UI and backend response time.
	- The realtime updates provided by GraphQL subscriptions was a win.

- Testing and Debugging
	- Created unit tests for most of UI elements
	- No E2E or functional tests due to time constraints

### Highlights and findings
- Shifting the focus from research, journalism, blogging to data collection
	- Changing "Journalism/Research Collaboration Platform." to "Data Collection Platform."
	- The "Article" might evolve to different types: videos, report, research paper etc
	- Tasks  should be kept as is because they are neutral
- Researchers seem to lack any useful tools unlike reporters that may work for larger corporations. In both cases however, individuals and small teams don't have anything.

## Personal Evaluation

### Overall

#### Successes

During the course of this project, I managed to successfully implement the core features of The Grid as I had initially envisioned them within the given time frame. Furthermore, I was able to persuade two professional teams to test The Grid in their work, which provided valuable insights and feedback.

#### Failures

Despite my efforts, I was unable to completely eliminate the confusion surrounding certain concepts within the platform. Additionally, I almost missed the project deadline, but fortunately, an extension was granted, which seemed to apply to everyone involved.

#### Limitations

Time constraints played a significant role in limiting the extent of UI improvements that could be made. Moreover, the test user base was limited, and a larger pool of users would have provided more diverse and professional feedback for further development.

#### Possible Extensions

One possible extension to explore is the integration of AI into the platform. Preliminary tests have already demonstrated the potential for generating meaningful GraphQL queries based on given natural language requests.

### Technical

#### Technologies Used

I am satisfied with the chosen languages and frameworks for this project. However, I experienced a steep learning curve when onboarding with Vue, GraphQL, Hasura, and other technologies.

#### Performance and Optimization

The platform displayed excellent performance when hosted on a regular server, with both the UI and backend response times being outstanding. Furthermore, the real-time updates provided by GraphQL subscriptions proved to be a significant advantage in terms of user experience.

#### Testing and Debugging

I developed unit tests for most of the UI elements to ensure proper functionality. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to create end-to-end or functional tests for the platform.

### Highlights and Findings

During the project, I shifted the focus from research, journalism, and blogging to data collection. This change involved modifying the platform description from "Journalism/Research Collaboration Platform" to "Data Collection Platform." The "Article" concept may evolve into various types, such as videos, reports, or research papers, allowing for a more flexible platform. Tasks should remain unchanged due to their neutrality and adaptability.

It became apparent that researchers often lack useful tools, unlike reporters who may work for larger corporations. However, in both cases, individuals and small teams tend to lack adequate resources. This observation highlights the potential value of The Grid for these target audiences.
