> In this assignment you will submit a design for this project.

It should include:
-   An overview of the project
-   Name which template you have used for the project
-   Explain the domain and users of the project. Who is the project for? What is the domain of the project (e.g. music game, history education, therapy for phobias, narrative films)?
-   Justify your design choices based on the needs of users/the requirements of the domain
-   The overall structure of the project (this could be the architecture of a software project, the story of a VR project, the visual interface of a mobile app or the research question and methods of a data science project)
-   Identification of the most important technologies and methods you will be using in the project
-   A plan of your work. This should include the major tasks and when you will do them laid out visually (for example in a Gantt chart)
-   A plan for how you will test and evaluate your project.
