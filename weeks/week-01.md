# Module Author Interviews - Project Templates

What makes a good project?
- Completeness
- Choose something passionate and motivated about

Mistakes
- Bad implementation
- No evaluation
- Trying to work on a huge and vague idea

## Template ideas

## CM3035 Advanced Web Development
1. Non-profit web application
  > Build a web application that can help users tackle or solve a socially useful problem in the non-profit sector.

2. Collaboration web application
  > Build an application that helps people collaborate more effectively

## CM3050 Mobile Development
1. Task manager mobile app
  > An application that provides a simple way of logging a series of tasks to complete. Presenting them alongside the necessary information required complete them such as notes, attachments, calendar information, and the timeframe in which it is required to do complete them.

2. Word-based game
> A fun, word-based game that can be played on any mobile device. The game should use finding words as the core game mechanic and should aim to be a casual game, that is often played in short sporadic opportunities, such as while on a train.

## CM3010 Databases and Advanced Data Techniques
1. Convert an existing Open Data resource into Linked Data and connect it to something else (example: concert data)
> Combining datasets allows more powerful search and knowledge discovery. An example is concert data where many organisations publish information, but it can not be cross-referenced.

2. Convert between XML formats, updating a dataset (example: CMME)
> XML (and SGML before it) have been used to construct data encoding standards for long enough that multiple, incompatible datasets have come about. Moving between these formats is often possible using XSLT or XQuery, but making a converter requires knowledge of both data models. In some cases, automatic conversion may be impossible, and user input may be needed.

## CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks
2. Gather your own dataset
  > Gathering a data set and training a model to develop a classification system
